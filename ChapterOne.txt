What are Compilers adn Interpreters?

The main purpose of a compiler and interpreters is to translate
a program written in a high-level programming language into
a form that a computer can understand in order to execute the program. 

A compiler translates a program into a low-level object language.
The compiler translates each source file into an object file.

linker compines the objects files into the object program. 
You can load it into the computer's memory and then execute it. 

On the other hands, an interpreter does not produce an object program. 
It may translate the source program into an internal intermediate code
that it can execute more effieciently.
